#  How to put your company's name onto the Goehte port machine

-To be able to put your company’s name on the Goehte port machine, you need to apply for a port authorization. This can be done through the “Munich Port Authority” (MA) website.

-In order to initiate the application process, you first need to create an account with the MA. After creating your account, you will be able to access the application form under the tab “Applications/forms”.

-The form requires some general information about your company such as its legal form, company name and address. Furthermore, you will have to provide a short description of your company and its activities.

-The most important part of the application is the justification of why your company needs its own port notation. You will have to provide evidence that using the regular commercial shipping routes is not feasible or would be unreasonably expensive.

# How to use a port notation for your company's goods

If your company has been granted a port notation, this allows you to use that specific port for shipping your goods. The port notation is listed on all maritime transport documents such as bills of lading and manifests. It serves as proof that the goods were actually shipped from that particular port.

This can be useful if you want to keep track of where your goods are coming from or if you experience problems with customs or other authorities. In case of doubt, you can always produce the relevant transport documents as evidence that the goods were indeed shipped from the correct port.
