#  Falcons favored by 3.5 against Panthers

The Falcons are favored by 3.5 points against the Panthers in the opening game of the season. The Panthers are coming off a Super Bowl appearance, while the Falcons missed the playoffs last year.

The Falcons have a new offensive coordinator this year in Steve Sarkisian, who is looking to improve on an offense that was ranked 25th in the league last year. The Panthers have a new defensive coordinator this year in Steve Wilks, who is looking to improve on a defense that was ranked seventh in the league last year.

The Falcons lost their starting left tackle Jake Matthews for at least 4-6 weeks with a hamstring injury, which could be a big problem against Defensive End Julius Peppers of the Panthers. The Panthers also have Cornerback James Bradberry, who is one of the best young cornerbacks in the league.

Both teams have new quarterbacks this year. The Falcons traded for former Denver Broncos quarterback Kyle Orton, while the Panthers drafted former Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota.

Overall, I think the Falcons are a better team than the Panthers and will win by a score of 24-17.

#  Panthers look to jump on Falcons early

The Carolina Panthers will be looking to take an early lead against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday.

"We want to jump on them early and put them in a hole," said Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly.

Kuechly and the Panthers defense will have their work cut out for them, as the Falcons boast one of the most high-powered offenses in the NFL. Led by quarterback Matt Ryan, wide receiver Julio Jones and running back Devonta Freeman, the Falcons rank third in the league in total offense.

But the Panthers aren't worried.

"We're not too concerned about their offense," said Kuechly. "We know we can stop them."

The Panthers will need to play stout defense if they want to win on Sunday. The Falcons are coming off a bye week and will be well rested heading into this matchup.

In order to win, the Panthers will need a strong performance from quarterback Cam Newton. Newton has struggled at times this season, but he'll need to be sharp against the Falcons defense. The Panthers also need to get a strong performance from their running game, led by Jonathan Stewart and Christian McCaffrey.

If the Panthers can take an early lead and force Ryan and the Falcons into long-yardage situations, they'll have a good chance of coming away with a victory on Sunday.

#  Julio Jones questionable for Falcons

The Atlanta Falcons may be without one of their top offensive players on Sunday as wide receiver Julio Jones is listed as questionable for the game against the Carolina Panthers.

Jones has been dealing with a foot injury for most of the season, and he was limited in practice all week. It's not clear yet if he will be able to play on Sunday, but even if he does, it's possible that he won't be at full strength.

The Falcons are already dealing with some other injuries on offense, including the loss of running back Tevin Coleman. If Jones is unable to play, that will leave Matt Ryan without his top two receivers from a year ago.

Ryan will likely look to Calvin Ridley and Mohamed Sanu to carry the load at receiver, but neither player has the same type of talent as Jones. The Panthers will likely try to take advantage of that mismatch by putting extra coverage on Ridley and Sanu.

If Jones is able to play on Sunday, it will be important for him to get off to a good start. He had just three receptions for 24 yards in the team's last game against the Green Bay Packers, and the Panthers have been tough against opposing receivers this year.

Jones will need to show that he's still capable of being one of the best receivers in the NFL if the Falcons are going to have any chance of winning on Sunday.

#  Could this be the game that Carolina breaks through?

It feels like this is the year Carolina breaks through and becomes a real contender in the NFL. I know they were in the Super Bowl not too long ago, but they feel like they have something to prove this season. And as a Panthers fan, that’s definitely an exciting prospect.

The biggest reason for optimism is their quarterback, Cam Newton. He had an MVP-type season last year and looks poised to continue that this season. With weapons like Kelvin Benjamin and Greg Olsen at his disposal, he should be able to rack up the yards and touchdowns again this year.

Another big factor for the Panthers is their defense. They’ve been one of the better defenses in the league for a few years now and that doesn’t look likely to change anytime soon. This could be the key to them finally making a Super Bowl run.

The only question mark for Carolina is their running game. It wasn’t particularly good last year and they didn’t make any significant additions in that area this offseason. However, with Newton also being a threat on the ground, it may not be as big of a issue as it seems on paper.

All things considered, I think Carolina has what it takes to make a serious run at the Super Bowl this year. It should be an exciting season for Panthers fans!

#  Record-breaking betting week for Atlanta

Atlanta had a record-breaking betting week, with the Falcons winning all six of their games against the spread. Bettors piled into Atlanta as they started off as 2-point home underdogs against the Panthers but quickly became popular favorites, closing at -7.5. Atlanta delivered against the spread in a big way and many lucky bettors were rewarded with a healthy payday."

The Bears, Buccaneers, Browns, Cowboys, Lions and Rams were also beneficiaries of heavy betting action this past week. All six of these teams covered the spread and it’s no coincidence that all six are considered to be poor NFL teams. Bettors looking for value put their money on these teams and were rewarded with a combined record of 12-4 against the spread.

While some professional handicappers preach the importance of never betting on bad teams, that strategy didn’t work so well this past week. It’s important to remember that NFL lines are set based on public perceptions and most people are inclined to bet on good teams. When an underdog is getting significant action from the public, it often indicates that the line has been overadjusted and presents value for sharp bettors. This was clearly the case this past week as underdog teams went 12-4 ATS.

It will be interesting to see if bettors continue to back these teams going forward or if they have already factored in their recent success and become more selective with their bets. The next few weeks should provide some valuable insights into how NFL bettors are thinking about this season
