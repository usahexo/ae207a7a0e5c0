#  When you know you have a new gambling problem

It can be hard to admit that you have a problem with gambling. Sometimes, it’s only after you have lost a lot of money and begun to feel desperate that you realize you have a gambling addiction. If this sounds like you, don’t worry – there is help available.

The first step is acknowledging that there is a problem. Once you have done that, the next step is seeking help. There are several different forms of help available, from self-help groups to professional counseling. It’s important to find the type of help that works best for you.

If you are having trouble controlling your gambling, it’s important to get help before the problem gets worse. Gambling can be addictive, and it can be difficult to break the cycle on your own. Treatment can help you overcome your addiction and learn how to manage your gambling behavior.

If you think you may have a gambling problem, don’t wait – seek help today. The earlier you get treatment, the better chance you have of overcoming your addiction and reclaiming your life.

#  The tell-tale signs you have a new gambling problem
According to NHS, if you're worried that you or someone you know may have a gambling addiction, there are some tell-tale signs to look out for. These include:

* Gambling more than you can afford to lose
* Feeling like you have to keep gambling to make money back
* Hiding your gambling from family and friends
* Losing interest in activities that used to be enjoyable
* Feeling depressed, anxious or stressed because of gambling
* Becoming argumentative or secretive about your gambling.

If you recognise any of these signs in yourself or someone else, it's important to seek help as soon as possible. Gambling addiction can be very destructive and can ruin relationships, jobs and financial stability. There are treatments available that can help people overcome their addiction, but it's best to seek professional help early on before the problem gets too out of control.

#  How to know if you're developing a new gambling problem

If you're worried that your gambling might be spiralling out of control, there are certain signs you can look for to help determine whether this is the case. Here are four key red flags to watch out for:

1. You're gambling more money than you can afford to lose

One of the most common warning signs of a developing gambling problem is when you start to gamble more money than you can actually afford. If you find yourself constantly dipping into your savings or racking up debts in order to fund your gambling activities, then this could be a sign that you need help.

2. You're obsessing over your bets

Another sign that your gambling might be getting out of control is when you start to obsess over your bets. If you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time and constantly trying to come up with new strategies to increase your chances of winning, then this could be a sign that you're in trouble.

3. Gambling is affecting your work or relationships

If your gambling is starting to have a negative impact on other areas of your life, it's definitely time to take a step back and reassess things. If you're skipping work or lying to your loved ones in order to gamble, then it's clear that the addiction has taken hold and it's time to get help.

4. You've tried to quit before but failed

If you've tried to quit gambling before but failed, this is another key indicator that you might have a problem. If you feel like you're unable to stop even though you know it's harming you, then it's likely that addiction has taken root and professional help is needed.

#  What to do if you realize you have a new gambling problem

If you're reading this, there's a good chance you've recently realized you might have a gambling problem. That's not a fun realization to come to, but at least you're doing something about it now. So what's the next step?

First, don't panic. There are plenty of people who have dealt with gambling problems and gone on to live happy, productive lives. Remember that you're not alone in this.

Next, reach out for help. There are plenty of resources available to people with gambling problems, and chances are there's someone who can help guide you through this process. Organizations like Gamblers Anonymous can be a huge help, as can individual therapists or counselors.

Finally, be honest with yourself. It's going to be difficult, but you need to admit that you have a problem and that you need help dealing with it. Only by being honest can you hope to overcome your gambling addiction.

#  How to get help for a new gambling problem

Whatever route you choose, it is important to get help as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to overcome your addiction.
