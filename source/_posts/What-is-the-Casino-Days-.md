#  What is East Timor? 
East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste, is an island country located in Southeast Asia, specifically in the Maritime Southeast Asia. It is a small country with a total area of 15,007 km² (5,792 sq mi) and a population of 1.3 million, making it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. East Timor is bordered by Indonesia to the west and northwest, and by Australia to the south. The capital and largest city is Dili. 

East Timor gained its independence from Portugal on May 20, 2002, after more than 400 years of Portuguese colonial rule. The country struggled economically in the years following independence due to instability caused by internal conflict and occupation by Indonesia from 1975 to 1999. In 2006, East Timor's Standard of Living improved due to an increase in oil and gas prices which led to increased government revenue. However, it remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. 

East Timor has a mixed economy based on agriculture, fisheries, mining (including oil and gas), and tourism. The country has substantial untapped hydroelectric potential which could be developed in the future. Agriculture employs around two-thirds of East Timor's workforce, while coffee is the country's major export crop. Fishing is also a major industry with exports going mostly to Japan and South Korea. 

East Timor's economy suffered significantly following the withdrawal of international peacekeepers and closure of UNMIT on December 31, 2012. The Australian government estimated that GDP growth would slow to just 1% in 2013 as a result. However, there are positive signs with growth projected at 4% for 2014 as oil production increases.

#  Why do people gamble? 

People gamble for a variety of reasons including the hope of winning money, entertainment, and to socialize. Some people also gamble as a form of escape or to relieve boredom.

People gamble for the hope of winning money. Gambling can be fun and entertaining, but it can also be stressful if you are not winning. The possibility of winning money is what keeps many people coming back to gamble.

Entertainment is another reason why people gamble. Gambling can be exciting and there is always the chance of winning big. This excitement can keep people coming back to gamble even if they are not winning consistently.

Socializing is another reason why people gamble. Gambling can be a fun way to spend time with friends and family. It can also be a way to meet new people.

#  Is gambling a sin?

Gambling has been around for centuries and there is no one definitive answer to whether or not it is a sin. Opinions on the matter vary from person to person, and even from religious group to religious group.

Some people believe that gambling is a sin because it is a form of greed. They believe that it is wrong to take money away from someone else in order to increase your own wealth. Others believe that gambling is a sin because it is a form of betting, and betting can lead to greed, addiction, and other harmful behaviors.

There are also people who believe that gambling is not a sin. Some say that as long as you are not harming anyone else and are only gambling for fun, then there is no harm in it. Others believe that if you are able to control your gambling habits and do not let them get out of hand, then there is no harm in it.

Ultimately, the decision on whether or not gambling is a sin lies with each individual person. Each person needs to decide for themselves what they believe is right and wrong. If you have any concerns about whether or not gambling is sinful, you should speak with your pastor or another religious authority figure for guidance.
