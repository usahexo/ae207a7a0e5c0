#  How to Play Blackjack Like Hemingway

Blackjack is a casino game that was originally played with two cards. It is now often played with six decks of cards. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over, or by collecting more points than the dealer.

Players are dealt two cards face up and the dealer is dealt one card face down and one card face up. Players then take turns in either taking another card (hit) or sticking (standing). If their total score exceeds 21 they bust and lose automatically, no matter what the dealer's score is. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. After all players have had their turn, the dealer deals another card to themselves, this time face up, and decides whether to hit or stand depending on the total score of their cards. If the dealer busts, all players who have not busted win.

In order to play blackjack like Hemingway, there are a few basic tips that you need to follow:

1) Firstly, always bet what you can afford to lose. Blackjack can be a very addictive game and it is easy to lose track of how much money you are spending.

2) Always split aces and eights. When you are dealt an ace and an eight, splitting them gives you two chances of getting closer to 21.

3) Never take insurance. Hemingway believed that insurance was a 'sucker's bet'. This is because it is very unlikely that the dealer has blackjack (a hand consisting of an ace and a ten), which is the only time insurance would be worth taking.

4) Try not to go over 21. Although it is possible to win even if you go over 21, it significantly reduces your chances of winning compared with staying under 21.
