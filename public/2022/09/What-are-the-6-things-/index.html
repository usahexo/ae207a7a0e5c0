        <h1 id="What-are-the-6-things"><a href="#What-are-the-6-things" class="headerlink" title="What are the 6 things?"></a>What are the 6 things?</h1><p>The “6 things” is a phrase used to describe the six most important things in someone’s life. The phrase was popularized by Wayne Dyer in his book, “The Six Things.” According to Dyer, the six things are: God, family, health, friends, love, and work.</p>
<p>Each person has their own unique set of six things. There is no universal list of the six things that applies to everyone. What’s important to one person may not be important to another person.</p>
<p>However, there are some general themes that often appear in people’s lists of six things. Most people place a high priority on their relationships with family and friends, their physical and mental health, and their career or work.</p>
<p>Some people also include love as one of their six things. Others may place a higher priority on personal values or spirituality than on work or relationships. The six things are personal and vary from person to person.</p>
<h1 id="Why-should-you-never-do-them"><a href="#Why-should-you-never-do-them" class="headerlink" title="Why should you never do them?"></a>Why should you never do them?</h1><p>There are plenty of reasons why you should never do some things in life.  Here are the top three reasons why you should never do the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>Never give up on your dreams - if you don’t pursue your dreams, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. </li>
<li>Never stop learning - if you stop learning, you’ll stop growing as a person. </li>
<li>Never stop being yourself - be yourself and be proud of who you are!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Who-decided-on-the-6-things"><a href="#Who-decided-on-the-6-things" class="headerlink" title="Who decided on the 6 things?"></a>Who decided on the 6 things?</h1><p>The six timeless principles of design were not arbitrarily chosen, but have been proven time and again in both the digital and physical realms. Each principle is essential for creating a well-rounded and successful design.</p>
<h1 id="1-Layout"><a href="#1-Layout" class="headerlink" title="1. Layout"></a>1. Layout</h1><p>Layout is key to ensuring that your design is easy to understand and use. It involves the careful arrangement of all elements on the page, from text to images to buttons. A good layout makes your design look professional and organized, while a bad one can make it difficult to read or use.</p>
<h1 id="2-Typography"><a href="#2-Typography" class="headerlink" title="2. Typography"></a>2. Typography</h1><p> Typography is all about the use of fonts, sizes, and styles to create an overall look and feel for your design. Poor typography can make your text difficult to read, while good typography can make it more readable and appealing.</p>
<h1 id="3-Color"><a href="#3-Color" class="headerlink" title="3. Color"></a>3. Color</h1><p>Color plays a huge role in any design, affecting everything from mood to usability. It’s important to choose colors that work well together and create the right mood for your project.</p>
<h1 id="4-Contrast"><a href="#4-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="4. Contrast"></a>4. Contrast</h1><p>Contrast is what helps your elements stand out against each other, making them easier to see and use. A lack of contrast can make your design look bland or confusing, while good contrast will help it stand out and be more effective.</p>
<h1 id="5-Balance"><a href="#5-Balance" class="headerlink" title="5. Balance"></a>5. Balance</h1><p>Balance is important for keeping your design looking cohesive and polished. An unbalanced design can look messy or cluttered, while a well-balanced one will be more visually appealing.</p>
<h1 id="6-Proximity"><a href="#6-Proximity" class="headerlink" title="6. Proximity"></a>6. Proximity</h1><p>Proximity refers to how close or far apart different elements are from each other. Closely grouped elements create a cohesive whole, while spaced-out elements give the eye room to rest.</p>
<h1 id="When-did-they-come-up-with-the-6-things"><a href="#When-did-they-come-up-with-the-6-things" class="headerlink" title="When did they come up with the 6 things?"></a>When did they come up with the 6 things?</h1><p>The “6 things” was first mentioned in a sermon by Rick Warren at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, on October 5, 2003. The sermon was based on the following Bible passage:</p>
<p>Warren’s point was that churches have been guilty of trying to do too many things, when they should be concentrating on just six areas: worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry, evangelism and giving. </p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-6-things-1"><a href="#What-are-the-6-things-1" class="headerlink" title="What are the 6 things?"></a>What are the 6 things?</h1><p>The six areas which Rick Warren urges churches to concentrate on are: worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry, evangelism and giving. </p>
<h1 id="How-do-people-feel-about-the-6-things"><a href="#How-do-people-feel-about-the-6-things" class="headerlink" title="How do people feel about the 6 things?"></a>How do people feel about the 6 things?</h1><p>There are six things that people seem to feel differently about. Some people love them, and others can’t stand them. Let’s take a look at what those six things are.</p>
<h1 id="1-The-color-green"><a href="#1-The-color-green" class="headerlink" title="1 The color green"></a>1 The color green</h1><p>The color green is one of the things that people feel differently about. Some people love the color, while others find it to be ugly. I happen to love the color green. It’s my favorite color, and I think it’s beautiful.</p>
<p>I think the reason some people don’t like the color green is because they associate it with sickness or envy. But green can also be associated with happiness and new beginnings. I think the positive connotations of the color override any negative associations for me.</p>
<h1 id="2-Spicy-food"><a href="#2-Spicy-food" class="headerlink" title="2 Spicy food"></a>2 Spicy food</h1><p>Another thing that people feel differently about is spicy food. Some people love it, while others can’t stand it. I happen to fall into the category of people who love spicy food. In fact, I crave it sometimes.</p>
<p>I think spicy food is delicious, and I always enjoy eating it. I don’t know why some people don’t like it, but to each their own. If you don’t like spicy food, that’s okay too. There are plenty of other foods out there for you to enjoy.</p>
<h1 id="3-Dogs"><a href="#3-Dogs" class="headerlink" title="3 Dogs"></a>3 Dogs</h1><p>Dogs are another thing that people feel differently about. Some people love them, while others find them annoying or even scary. I myself am a dog lover, and I think they’re adorable creatures.</p>
<p>I think dogs make great pets because they’re so loyal and loving. They also provide companionship, which is something many people need in their lives. If you’re not a dog person, that’s okay too. There are plenty of other types of pets out there for you to choose from.</p>
