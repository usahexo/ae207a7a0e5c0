        <h1 id="Indiana-Resident-Gets-Michigan-Gambling-Tax-Withheld-Refunded"><a href="#Indiana-Resident-Gets-Michigan-Gambling-Tax-Withheld-Refunded" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Resident Gets Michigan Gambling Tax Withheld Refunded"></a>Indiana Resident Gets Michigan Gambling Tax Withheld Refunded</h1><p>An Indiana resident recently had their Michigan gambling tax withholding refunded. Gambling taxes are withheld from winnings over $600, and the state of Michigan charges a 6% tax on those winnings. The Indiana resident had their refund processed and mailed to them in late February.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of six states that charges a gambling tax. The other states are Nevada, New Jersey, South Dakota, Oregon, and Delaware. Most states do not charge a gambling tax, but there is no definitive answer as to why these six states charge one.</p>
<p>The amount of money that the state of Michigan collects from its gambling tax is relatively small; in 2017, it brought in just over $2 million. This pales in comparison to the state’s total budget of over $56 billion. However, for the people who have their taxes withheld from their gambling winnings, it can be a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>In January 2019, a Michigan judge ordered the state to pay nearly $4 million in restitution to two Detroit casinos. This was in relation to back taxes that the state had withheld from the casinos’ winnings since 2009. The casinos argued that the state did not have the authority to withhold the taxes in the first place, and they were successful in getting the money paid back to them.</p>
<p>While most people who have their gambling winnings taxed are happy to receive their refunds, there are some who feel that the tax is unfair. One such person is Julie Mack, a columnist for The Chronicle News in Muskegon Heights, Michigan. Mack has written about how the tax unfairly targets low-income people who regularly gamble at local casinos. She argues that these people are already struggling financially and should not have to pay an additional 6%tax on top of what they have lost.</p>
<p>Others argue that the gambling tax is necessary in order to help offset the costs incurred by gambling addiction. According to research published by Wayne State University professor Andres Merlo-Pichardo, Michigan spends around $542 million every year on problems related to gambling addiction. This includes costs for public assistance programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, as well as law enforcement and criminal justice expenses .</p>
<p>The debate over whether or not Michigan should continue to charge its 6% gambling tax will likely continue for some time. In the meantime, those who have their taxes withheld from their winnings can rest assured knowing that they will get their money back eventually</p>

After years of waiting, an Indiana resident has had their Michigan gambling tax withholding refunded. The individual filed a claim with the state in early 2018 and finally received a response earlier this year.</p>
<p>According to the Michigan Department of Treasury, the person’s withholding was incorrect because they were an Indiana resident and not a Michigan one. The individual had worked in Detroit for a casino that was subject to the Michigan gambling tax and had their wages withheld. However, since they were not a resident of Michigan, the withholding was done incorrectly.</p>
<p>The state determined that the individual was owed more than $1,600 in withheld taxes and also interest on that amount dating back to 2014. In total, the individual received just over $1,900 in restitution from the state. While it took some time to receive, the individual is glad to have the money returned to them.</p>
<p>If you are an Indiana resident who has had withholding taken from your wages for Michigan gambling taxes, be sure to file a claim with the state. You may be due a refund for those incorrect withholdings.</p>

The Indiana Attorney General’s office has not issued an opinion on the matter, so there is no definitive answer to the question of what rights the resident has.</p>
<p>There are a few potential courses of action that the resident could take. They could try to negotiate with the casino or state of Michigan to get back the money that was withheld. They could also file a lawsuit in order to get a ruling on the legality of the withholding.</p>
<p>It is likely that any legal action would be successful, as there does not seem to be any clear justification for the withholding. However, it would likely be a costly and time-consuming process. Therefore, it may be more practical for the resident to simply try and negotiate with the casino or state government in order to get back at least some of the money that was withheld.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Resident-Fights-For-Michigan-Gambling-Tax-Withheld-Refund"><a href="#Indiana-Resident-Fights-For-Michigan-Gambling-Tax-Withheld-Refund" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Resident Fights For Michigan Gambling Tax Withheld Refund"></a>Indiana Resident Fights For Michigan Gambling Tax Withheld Refund</h1><p>In June of this year, Indiana resident David N. filed a lawsuit against the State of Michigan claiming the state wrongfully withheld his gambling tax refund. N. is seeking repayment of the $4,532 he claims was illegally taken from him.</p>
<p>The basis for N.’s suit is that Michigan’s gambling tax is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The state imposes the tax on gambling winnings regardless of whether the gambler is a Michigan resident or not. This, argues N., amounts to discrimination against out-of-state gamblers and constitutes a violation of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause.</p>
<p>N. has already had some success in his legal challenge. In September, a federal court ruled in his favor and ordered Michigan to return his money. However, the state has appealed that ruling and the case is now pending before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Michigan’s Deputy Attorney General, Eric Smith, argues that the state has a legitimate interest in taxing gambling income regardless of where it was earned. He also contends that the tax does not discriminate against out-of-state gamblers because all gamblers are subject to it, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>The Sixth Circuit is expected to rule on the case in early 2018.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Get-Michigan-Gambling-Tax-Withheld-Refunded-If-You’re-an-Indiana-Resident"><a href="#How-to-Get-Michigan-Gambling-Tax-Withheld-Refunded-If-You’re-an-Indiana-Resident" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Michigan Gambling Tax Withheld Refunded If You’re an Indiana Resident"></a>How to Get Michigan Gambling Tax Withheld Refunded If You’re an Indiana Resident</h1><p>Did you know that you may be able to get a Michigan gambling tax withheld refunded if you’re an Indiana resident? Here’s how:</p>
<p>To qualify for the refund, you must have lived in Indiana during the year in which the Michigan gambling taxes were withheld. You must also have filed a federal income tax return and claimed a Michigan gambling loss on that return.</p>
<p>If all of these conditions are met, you can claim a refund of the Michigan gambling taxes withheld from your winnings. The amount of the refund will be based on the amount of your federal income tax liability reduced by your Michigan gambling loss deduction.</p>
<p>You can claim the refund on Form IT-40PNR, which is available from the Indiana Department of Revenue. Be sure to include copies of your federal income tax return, W-2 forms, and receipts for your Michigan gambling losses with your completed Form IT-40PNR.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about getting a Michigan gambling tax withheld refunded, be sure to contact the Indiana Department of Revenue.</p>
