        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-The-Nation-In-Casino-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-The-Nation-In-Casino-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads The Nation In Casino Gambling Losses"></a>Nevada Leads The Nation In Casino Gambling Losses</h1><p>Nevada gambling losses totaled $2.7 billion in 2016, leading the nation for the ninth consecutive year. Gambling losses per resident in Nevada were $1,084, more than twice the national average of $459.</p>
<p>Casino gambling accounted for $2.4 billion of the total losses, while race and sports betting accounted for another $274 million. Slot machines were the biggest contributor to casino losses, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total.</p>
<p>The state’s casinos paid out $1.5 billion in winnings last year, resulting in a net loss of $879 million. This was down from a net loss of $1.1 billion in 2015.</p>
<p>While Nevada continues to lead the nation in gambling losses, its market share is shrinking. The state’s share of national gambling losses was 29 percent in 2016, down from 33 percent in 2015 and 37 percent in 2014.</p>
<p>The decline is attributable to increasing competition from other states, as well as the growing popularity of online gambling options.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Casinos-Lose-1-2B-In-2017"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Casinos-Lose-1-2B-In-2017" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Casinos Lose $1.2B In 2017"></a>Atlantic City Casinos Lose $1.2B In 2017</h1><p>Atlantic City casinos were dealt a bad hand in 2017, losing $1.2B, according to a recent study. This marks the fourth consecutive year of dips in revenue for the city’s gambling venues, which have been struggling to keep up with casino competition in other states.</p>
<p>Revenue losses were especially sharp at the city’s seven brick-and-mortar casinos, which saw a total of $1.1B in losses last year. This was down from the $1.5B in revenue these casinos generated in 2012.</p>
<p>The downturn can be largely attributed to increasing competition from casinos in neighboring states, as well as the impact of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Atlantic City’s 12 resorts and casinos have been fighting to stay afloat ever since, with some closures and job cuts along the way.</p>
<p>The good news is that Atlantic City’s online gambling industry is doing well, with revenues reaching $206M last year. This helped soften the blow somewhat for the city, but it’s not enough to make up for the big losses at the brick-and-mortar casinos.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Atlantic City can turn things around in 2018, but it’s clear that the casino industry is facing some major challenges.</p>
<h1 id="Americans-Spend-More-On-Gambling-Than-Netflix-Hulu-And-Spotify-Combined"><a href="#Americans-Spend-More-On-Gambling-Than-Netflix-Hulu-And-Spotify-Combined" class="headerlink" title="Americans Spend More On Gambling Than Netflix, Hulu, And Spotify Combined"></a>Americans Spend More On Gambling Than Netflix, Hulu, And Spotify Combined</h1><p>According to a new report, Americans spent more money gambling in 2017 than they did on streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify combined.</p>
<p>The report, which was released by the American Gaming Association (AGA), found that Americans spent nearly $US 50 billion on gambling last year. That’s more than double the $US 22.9 billion that was spent on streaming services in 2017.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while Americans are spending more money on gambling than ever before, the amount of money they’re spending on streaming services is actually declining. In 2016, Americans spent $US 30.4 billion on gambling and $US 29.8 billion on streaming services.</p>
<p>So why are Americans spending more money on gambling than ever before? There are a few possible explanations.</p>
<p>For one thing, gambling has become increasingly accessible in recent years. There are now more casinos and gaming venues than ever before, and online gambling has become increasingly popular.</p>
<p> Additionally, legalised sports betting may be contributing to the growth in gambling spending. In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that states could legalise sports betting, and since then a number of states have done just that. This has likely made gambling more accessible and attractive to consumers.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the $US 50 billion figure includes both illegal and legal gambling activities. So it’s possible that even more money is being spent on gambling overall than what’s being reported here.</p>
<p>Regardless of the exact figure, it’s clear that Americans are spending a lot of money on gambling – and this trend is likely to continue in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-in-Las-Vegas-top-10-billion-for-first-time"><a href="#Gambling-losses-in-Las-Vegas-top-10-billion-for-first-time" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses in Las Vegas top $10 billion for first time"></a>Gambling losses in Las Vegas top $10 billion for first time</h1><p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Gambling losses in Las Vegas topped $10 billion for the first time last year, propelled by the Strip’s record-breaking 2.3 billion in gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board said Tuesday that casinos statewide won just over $24.9 billion and lost nearly $35.8 billion during fiscal 2017, which ended June 30. That was the first time gambling losses exceeded winnings since 2007, when casinos earned $24.5 billion but lost $27.1 billion.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of the statewide loss came from casino floors on the Las Vegas Strip, where revenues grew by almost 5 percent even as gamblers lost more money. The Strip edged out Singapore to again become the world’s biggest gambling market.</p>

<p>Casino gambling continues to be a losing proposition for American taxpayers, according to a report from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. The report finds that while casinos may generate jobs and tax revenue, they also cost states and localities billions of dollars each year in social costs.</p>
<p>The report is the most comprehensive study to date on the effects of casino gambling on American communities. It found that casinos bring crime and social problems with them, including increased rates of divorce, bankruptcy, and suicide. Casinos also divert money away from other businesses, leading to the closure of hospitals, schools, and other vital services.</p>
<p>“Casino gambling is not the economic boon that its proponents claim,” said commission member Dr. John Kindt. “It actually costs states and localities more money than it generates in tax revenue.”</p>
<p>The commission’s findings are consistent with those of previous studies on casino gambling. A 1997 study by the Institute for American Values found that casinos cost states more money than they generated in benefits. And a 2006 study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that casinos caused crime rates to rise and led to negative social consequences.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, casino gambling continues to be expanding at an alarming rate. There are now 40 states with casinos, and more than 1,000 Native American tribes operate casinos nationwide.</p>
