Do you want to get the best rewards? This guide is for you!</p>
<p>First, you need to understand what the EDRS is. The EDRS is a roulette game that gives you rewards based on your class and job levels. The rewards can include experience points, Gil, gil pots, and items.</p>
<p>To unlock the EDRS, you first need to complete the main scenario quest “The Two Princes.” After completing this quest, speak with Gibrillont in Upper Decks (X:10 Y:11) to start the quest “The One You Seek.” He will then give you a key item called the “Unlocking Key.”</p>
<p>Next, speak with Sarasha in Mor Dhona (X:22 Y:8) to unlock the EDRS. She will ask you to complete a series of tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete three levequests in any area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Defeat six unique enemies in any area. A unique enemy is an enemy that appears once and does not respawn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Collect 300 plant life specimens from any area. A plant life specimen is an item that appears as ??? when examined. You do not need to collect 300 of them; 300 is the maximum number that can be collected at any one time. If you already have 300 plant life specimens, speak with Sarasha again to receive your rewards and start the next task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing these tasks, speak with Sarasha again to receive your rewards and start the next task.</p>
