      Tigers Lose Again, Bringing Them Closer to the Bottom of the Division

        <h1 id="Tigers-Lose-Again-Bringing-Them-Closer-to-the-Bottom-of-the-Division"><a href="#Tigers-Lose-Again-Bringing-Them-Closer-to-the-Bottom-of-the-Division" class="headerlink" title="Tigers Lose Again, Bringing Them Closer to the Bottom of the Division"></a>Tigers Lose Again, Bringing Them Closer to the Bottom of the Division</h1><p>The Detroit Tigers continued their downward spiral on the field with another loss, this time to the Kansas City Royals. This latest setback brings them closer to the bottom of the division, a spot they haven’t been in since early in the season.</p>
<p>The Tigers jumped out to an early lead, but it wasn’t enough as they ultimately fell 6-4. It was another frustrating game for the team and their fans, as they simply couldn’t seem to get anything going late in the game.</p>
<p>This latest loss was particularly costly, as it means that the Royals have now pulled ahead of the Tigers in the standings. Detroit is now in fourth place in the division, with a record of 37-43.</p>
<p>Things don’t get any easier for the Tigers, as they will now have to face off against the Houston Astros. The Astros are one of the best teams in baseball and currently hold first place in the American League West Division.</p>
<p>Detroit will need to find a way to turn things around quickly if they hope to make a run at the playoffs. They still have plenty of time remaining in the season, but they need to start winning soon if they want to stay afloat.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Tigers-Fall-to-the-Chicago-Cubs-Bringing-Their-Win-Loss-Record-to-7-5"><a href="#Detroit-Tigers-Fall-to-the-Chicago-Cubs-Bringing-Their-Win-Loss-Record-to-7-5" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Tigers Fall to the Chicago Cubs, Bringing Their Win/Loss Record to -7.5"></a>Detroit Tigers Fall to the Chicago Cubs, Bringing Their Win/Loss Record to -7.5</h1><p>The Detroit Tigers faced off against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night. The game was played at Wrigley Field in Chicago and the Cubs were victorious, winning by a score of 8-3.</p>
<p>It was a rough night for the Tigers. They were only able to muster up three hits against the Cubs, who have one of the best pitching staffs in baseball. In addition, the Tigers bullpen allowed five runs to score, including four in the ninth inning.</p>
<p>The loss drops the Tigers’ win/loss record to 7-15 on the season. They remain in last place in the American League Central Division, 10 games behind the first-place Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>The Tigers will look to get back on track when they face off against the Minnesota Twins on Thursday night.</p>
<h1 id="Tigers-Slipping-in-the-Standings-What-Does-This-Mean-for-their-Future"><a href="#Tigers-Slipping-in-the-Standings-What-Does-This-Mean-for-their-Future" class="headerlink" title="Tigers Slipping in the Standings: What Does This Mean for their Future?"></a>Tigers Slipping in the Standings: What Does This Mean for their Future?</h1><p>The Detroit Tigers have been a staple in the AL Central for some time now. However, recently they have been slipping in the standings. This could mean big changes for their future.</p>
<p>Currently, the Tigers sit in last place in their division with a record of 33-42. This is a far cry from where they were last year at this time when they were in first place with a record of 43-37. So what has caused this decline?</p>
<p>There are many factors that have contributed to the Tigers’ fall. One is that their offense has not been as strong as it has been in past seasons. Another issue is that their pitching has not performed as well either. Lastly, their defense has also not been as strong.</p>
<p>All of these factors have resulted in the Tigers having one of their worst seasons ever. If they want to turn things around, they will need to address these issues and make some changes.</p>
<p>One change that could be made is firing manager Brad Ausmus. He has been with the team for four years now and it seems like it might be time for a change. The Tigers have not had much success under him and he may not be the right fit for them anymore.</p>
<p>Another change that could be made is trading some of their players. There are some players who may not be part of the team’s future and could be traded away for some younger talent. Players like Justin Verlander, Miguel Cabrera, and Victor Martinez may all be on the trading block if the Tigers want to rebuild.</p>
<p>Whatever changes the Tigers decide to make, they will need to do something soon if they want to salvage this season. They are falling behind in the standings and it will be difficult to catch up at this point. If they want to return to contention, they will need to make some big changes</p>
<h1 id="Detroit’s-Struggles-Continue-7-5-Games-Out-of-First-Place"><a href="#Detroit’s-Struggles-Continue-7-5-Games-Out-of-First-Place" class="headerlink" title="Detroit’s Struggles Continue: 7.5 Games Out of First Place"></a>Detroit’s Struggles Continue: 7.5 Games Out of First Place</h1><p>Detroit’s struggles continued this week as they fell 7.5 games out of first place in the AL Central. The Tigers have now lost six consecutive games and are in danger of falling out of playoff contention.</p>
<p>The Tigers were swept by the Cleveland Indians this week, with their only win coming on Sunday in a 10-9 victory. In that game, Detroit jumped out to an early 5-0 lead but squandered it and had to come back in the ninth inning.</p>
<p>The biggest issue for the Tigers has been their pitching. They have given up at least six runs in each of their last six games, and their starting pitchers have an ERA of 6.27 over that span.</p>
<p>One positive for Detroit has been the play of outfielder Nick Castellanos. Castellanos is batting .389 over his last 10 games and is currently tied for the team lead in home runs with 14.</p>
<p>The Tigers will look to get back on track when they face the Minnesota Twins this weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Tigers’-Odds-of-Making-the-Playoffs-Falling-Steadily"><a href="#Tigers’-Odds-of-Making-the-Playoffs-Falling-Steadily" class="headerlink" title="Tigers’ Odds of Making the Playoffs Falling Steadily"></a>Tigers’ Odds of Making the Playoffs Falling Steadily</h1><p>The Detroit Tigers are in the midst of a rebuild, and as such, their odds of making the playoffs this season have been falling steadily.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, the Tigers had roughly an 11% chance of making the playoffs. As of now, their odds sit at just 2%.</p>
<p>While it’s still technically possible for them to make the playoffs, it’s looking increasingly unlikely. They would need to jump all the way up to 4th place in the AL Central, and even then they would only have a 16% chance of making it in.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for their falling odds. First and foremost, they simply aren’t very good. They currently have the 3rd worst record in all of baseball.</p>
<p>Secondly, they’re facing stiff competition in their division. The Cleveland Indians are currently on pace to win 100 games, while the Minnesota Twins are right behind Detroit with a record of 41-40.</p>
<p>Finally, the Tigers don’t have many young players who are likely to contribute down the stretch. The team’s best prospects are currently playing in Double-A and below, which means that they’re not likely to help out this season.</p>
<p>All things considered, it’s looking like a long season for Tigers fans. However, there is some hope on the horizon, as the team is expected to be competitive again starting in 2019.</p>
